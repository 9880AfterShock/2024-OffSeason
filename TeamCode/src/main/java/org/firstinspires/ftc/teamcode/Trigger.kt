/**
 * This class is an example of a lift controlled by a single motor. Unlike the Intake example object, it can use
 * encoders to go to a set position. Its first two commands, toLow and toHigh, do just that. The start command turns
 * the motor on and lets it spin freely, and the reverse command does the same but in the opposite direction. The stop
 * command stops the motor. These last three are meant for use during the TeleOp period to control the lift manually.
 * To use this class, copy it into the proper package and change the first eight constants (COUNTS_PER_INCH is fine as
 * is).
